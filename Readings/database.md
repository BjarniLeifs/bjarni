To dump the database enter the following command in terminal or command prompt window

Replace mydb with the name of your database.

pg_dump mydb > db.sql

Example: My database is named databasename so my command would look like

pg_dump databasename > filename.sql

To restore the database to a new database use the following command.

psql -d newdb -f db.sql

Example: You created a new database called whatever so the command would look like

psql -d whatever -f file.sql

Or from pgAdmin console
\i 'path/to/database/file/dump.sql'
i.e. \i 'C:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/some_path....Ã¥/sqlSchems/database.sql'
